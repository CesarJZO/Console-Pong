# Pong

This is a **Pong** clone that runs on the terminal. It is rendered using simple ASCII characters and reproduces sounds when the ball hits the paddles or the walls.

.NET core 7.0 is required to run the application using the following command:

```powershell
dotnet run
```

A release is available for Windows. Just execute the .exe file.

## How to play

Press arrow keys or `W` and `S` keys to move up and down. When any of the players reaches 10 points, the game ends. Currently it's single player only.
